#So in what way in practical terms (Ownership and Borrowing) affect our programming
When we move to concurrent programming, it will have a new meaning, but smart pointers will do most hard lifting,for know we need to understand how to use them in procedural programming.


#A general guideline for working with references and functions is to prefer using an immutable reference whenever possible. This will ensure that the function only accesses the data and does not take ownership of it, making the code simpler and reducing the risk of unintended changes to the data. If ownership transfer is not required, using a reference is the most straightforward solution.


#In systems and network programming, also in any kind of distributed systems , it's much better idea to think about data in terms of bytes.
Rust go further and incorporates this idea in everything 
From now on everything is a byte :)

Google interview story 2 years ago:

Problem: You have a text file read last 10 lines.

I did not ask how many bytes one letter will take, before I reach separator like \n line character 

1 letter can take 1,2,3,4 bytes per character

Follow up: What you gonna do if you need to parse 1000 files and they are distributed across many servers

Welcome to the world of programming.

Warm-up
Problem #1
String Concatenation with Borrowing:

Write a function that concatenates two strings without taking ownership, i.e., by borrowing.

fn concat_strings(s1: &String, s2: &String) -> String {
    // Your code here
}

fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
    let s2 = String::from("World!");
    let result = concat_strings(&s1, &s2);
    println!("{}", result); // Should print: "Hello, World!"
}

Problem#2

Clone and Modify:

Given a string, clone it and modify the cloned string by appending a new word. Print both the original string and the cloned, modified string to show that the original has not been changed.

rust
Copy code
fn clone_and_modify(s: &String) -> String {
    // Your code here
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("Hello, ");
    let modified = clone_and_modify(&s);
    println!("Original: {}", s); // Should print: "Original: Hello, "
    println!("Modified: {}", modified); // Should print: "Modified: Hello, World!"
}
